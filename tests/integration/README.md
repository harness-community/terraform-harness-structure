# Terraform Modules Integration Testing
Terraform Module for creating and managing Harness Projects

## Summary
This module handle the creation and managment of projects by leveraging the Harness Terraform provider

## Providers
This module requires that the calling template has defined the [Harness Provider - Docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/harness/harness/latest/docs) authentication.

### Example setup of the Harness Provider Authentication with environment variables
You can also set up authentication with Harness through environment variables. To do this set the following items in your environment:
- HARNESS_ENDPOINT: Harness Platform URL, defaults to Harness SaaS URL: https://app.harness.io/gateway
- HARNESS_ACCOUNT_ID: Harness Platform Account Number
- HARNESS_PLATFORM_API_KEY: Harness Platform API Key for your account

### Example setup of the Harness Provider
```
# Provider Setup Details
variable "harness_platform_url" {
  type        = string
  description = "[Optional] Enter the Harness Platform URL.  Defaults to Harness SaaS URL"
  default     = null # If Not passed, then the ENV HARNESS_ENDPOINT will be used or the default value of "https://app.harness.io/gateway"
}

variable "harness_platform_account" {
  type        = string
  description = "[Required] Enter the Harness Platform Account Number"
  default     = null # If Not passed, then the ENV HARNESS_ACCOUNT_ID will be used
  sensitive   = true
}

variable "harness_platform_key" {
  type        = string
  description = "[Required] Enter the Harness Platform API Key for your account"
  default     = null # If Not passed, then the ENV HARNESS_PLATFORM_API_KEY will be used
  sensitive   = true
}

provider "harness" {
  endpoint         = var.harness_platform_url
  account_id       = var.harness_platform_account
  platform_api_key = var.harness_platform_key
}

```

### Terraform required providers declaration
```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    harness = {
      source  = "harness/harness"
      version = "~> 0.14.0"
    }
    time = {
      source  = "hashicorp/time"
      version = "~> 0.9.1"
    }
    random = {
      source  = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "~> 3.4.3"
    }
  }
}

```
