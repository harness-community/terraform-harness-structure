# Terraform Modules for Harness Platform Core Structure
A collection of Terraform resources used to support the base structure of the Harness Platform

## Goal
The goal of this repository is to provide simple to consume versions of the Harness Terraform resources in such a way to make the management of Harness via Terraform easy to adopt.

## Summary
This collection of Terraform modules focuses on the initial setup of Harness Platform configurations and base functionality.

## Providers
This module requires that the calling template has defined the [Harness Provider - Docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/harness/harness/latest/docs) authentication.

### Example setup of the Harness Provider
```
# Provider Setup Details
variable "harness_platform_url" {
  type        = string
  description = "[Optional] Enter the Harness Platform URL.  Defaults to Harness SaaS URL"
  default     = "https://app.harness.io/gateway"
}

variable "harness_platform_account" {
  type        = string
  description = "[Required] Enter the Harness Platform Account Number"
  default     = null # If Not passed, then the ENV HARNESS_ACCOUNT_ID will be used
  sensitive   = true
}

variable "harness_platform_key" {
  type        = string
  description = "[Required] Enter the Harness Platform API Key for your account"
  default     = null # If Not passed, then the ENV HARNESS_PLATFORM_API_KEY will be used
  sensitive   = true
}

provider "harness" {
  endpoint         = var.harness_platform_url
  account_id       = var.harness_platform_account
  platform_api_key = var.harness_platform_key
}

```

### Terraform required providers declaration
```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    harness = {
      source = "harness/harness"
    }
  }
}
```

## Variables

_Note: When the identifier variable is not provided, the module will automatically format the identifier based on the provided resource name_

| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | Mandatory |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| harness_platform_url | [Optional] Enter the Harness Platform URL.  Defaults to Harness SaaS URL | string | https://app.harness.io/gateway | |
| harness_platform_account | [Required] Enter the Harness Platform Account Number | string | | X |
| harness_platform_key | [Required] Enter the Harness Platform API Key for your account | string | | X |
| organization_name | Provide an organization name.  Must exist before execution | string | default | |
| project_name | Provide an project name in the chosen organization.  Must exist before execution | string | Default Project | |

## Examples
### Retrieve default module outputs
```
module "harness_structure" {
  source = "git@github.com:harness-community/terraform-harness-structure.git"

  harness_platform_account = "myaccount_id"
  harness_platform_key = "myplatform_key"
  organization_name = "default"
  project_name = "Default Project"
}
```
